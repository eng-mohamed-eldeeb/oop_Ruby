# OOP School Library

> Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. I used Opject Oriented Programming to create this app and it will allow a you to:
>- Add new students or teachers.
>- Add new books.
>- Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.
>
>And all of this built in a beautiful and well-organized way!
